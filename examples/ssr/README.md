# TailwindCSS SSR example

This is a copy-paste project from [Leptos with Axum + TailwindCSS Tempate](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/examples/tailwind_axum) with added example `<AnimatedFor ... />` usage. The elements are rendered server-side and can be animated once the WASM bundle is loaded in the browser.

## Running the application using [cargo-leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos)

```bash
cargo leptos watch
```
